              For this project, we were initally given images of small
              organisms, and explored tools in Adobe Illustrator by tracing them
              over to replicate their shape and form. From there, we were tasked
              with creating our custom letterforms using Illustrator, taking
              inspiration from the images we looked at.
              <br />
              For this project, I first spent time considering the shape and
              form of the letters, and how to make a series of unique letters
              fit within a theme. I ultimately decided on the concept of
              "ocean/marine life" after sketching out some potential concepts.
              Additionally, this theme kept consistency with the curves and
              smooth flow of organic life forms, such as the example photos we
              practiced on.

            src="sketch1.jpg"
            alt="A photo of an inital sketch of the letterforms, using pencil and paper."
          />
          <div>
            <p>
              Following the rough sketches, I began to digitize some of the ones
              I was pleased with, starting with the beginning of the alphabet. I
              realized it would also be effective to use similar design elements
              for different letters to bring more cohesion to the overall set.
              Using this process, I used Adobe Illustrator to create vector art
              of the letters, using the brush tool, gradients, and merging
              forms.
            </p>
          </div>
          <img
            class="tu"
            src="digitization.jpg"
            alt="A screenshot from Adobe Illustrator containing some letters being created. 
          The letters A through G are shown."
          />
          <div>
            <p>
              From here, I continued to develop and refine the letterforms
              according to the rough sketches and theme. For each letterform, I
              considered their overall cohesion with the others. If a letter
              felt too out of place, I considered if it would be satisfactory to
              pair it thematically or visually with another letterform. <br />
              For example, the letters A, F, G, and J all share the visual
              similarity of using a bold line to define the letter and its
              shape, and then uses other forms, colors, or lines to create an
              design which ties it to the theme.
              <br />
              Addiitonally, I did not want all the letters to have the same
              shape and form. I felt this would be too limiting, and would
              contradict the overall theme, since lifeforms are diverse in form.
              Many letterforms are curvy and lack sharp edges or straight lines,
              which I felt did not fit with the playfulness of life and the
              dynamic nature of the ocean.
              <br />
              From this process, I created the finalized letterform set, which
              can be viewed below. Many letters share a design theme with one
              another, and others are tied together by the overall theme of the
              letterform set.

          />
          <div>
            <p>
              This was a very challenging project, as I needed to carefully
              consider how form, color, and lines can create and suggest
              different letters. But I believe my finished project is a strong
              first venture into visual design, and I am proud of the work I
              created.
