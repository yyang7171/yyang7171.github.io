              The goal of this project was to complete a successful multipage
              re-design of an existing website using Figma. Requirements
              included components and animations.
              <br />
              For this project, I chose the Prince George's County Parks and
              Recreation website. The website contains useful information, but
              can be difficult to navigate due to redundant linking. A
              screenshot of the current site can be seen below.
            </p>
            <img
              class="tu"
              src="pgs.png"
              alt="A screenshot of the current PG County Parks and Rec site."
            />
            <p>
              The next step for this project was to create a moodboard with
              different sources of inspiration for the final design, alongside
              color palettes and fonts. Images were taken from other government
              sites and RED, a Pinterest-esque social media app. Color palettes
              were generated from these images using Adobe Color Wheel. Google
              Fonts was used to find different font options.
            </p>
            <img
              class="tu"
              src="pgm.png"
              alt="The moodboard for this project, with other natural park and 
              government sites as inspiration, as well as pictures of nature 
              and natural colors."
            />
            <p>
              The next step of the design process was to create low-fidelity
              wireframes/layouts of the final design. For this step, I first
              created the basic silhouettes of each page I wanted to include.
              <br />
              For this step, I created basic components to format using Auto
              Layout, so I could build off them later. I also included simple
              text to show different sections of the webpage, and where various
              content could be placed.
            </p>
            <img
              class="tu"
              src="pglf.png"
              alt="The low-fidelity wireframes of the re-design. There are 
            only simple forms showing how the webpages would be laid out, 
            and were different elements would be placed."
            />
            <p>
              After recieving feedback from the instructional team and my peers,
              I began to edit and build the final product.
              <br />
              During this stage I changed layouts for areas of the homepage, and
              worked to incorporate more images to the design. I also worked to
              refine the components so they would be more polished for the final
              version.
              <br />
              I sourced vector art from open-source vector art websites, and
              incorporated them into my re-design in various ways. For example,
              hovering over the footer will bring a deer and squirrel into view.
              I also made the park vector art on the homepage a navigation
              element as well. Some minor vector images were created using Adobe
              Illustrator, such as the recreation of the site logo.
              <br />
              However, at this stage, I also encountered some limitations of
              Figma. For example, there are limits on how many interactions can
              be added to a single element. This meant for my calendar, I could
              not show it highlighting the selected day in yellow and showing
              the events for December 2nd at the same time. The same applied to
              the global navigation menu in the header.
              <br />
              As a result, I limited the interactions I used on some elements in
              order to ensure there were examples of different interactions on
              the final product.
              <br />
              Finally, I added in simple animations when navigating between
              pages and clicking on different page elements. Then, I began to
              populate the re-design with images and text taken from the Prince
              George's County Parks and Recreation site. I finalized small
              design changes to account for the sizing of photos and added
              scrolling to account for text overflow.
              <br />
              This was a challenging re-design, as government websites need to
              provide large amounts of information for the general public.
              However, I believe I was successful in creating a re-design which
              is more visually appealing to users and easy to navigate. I gained
              valuable experience from this project, and it made me re-consider
              my own approach to design and presentation.
              <br />
              The final wireframes and prototype (best viewed in fullscreen) are
              viewable below.
              <br />
              Due to a technical issue with Figma, the wireframes are not
              viewable at the moment. My apologies for this inconvience, please
              refer to the video at the top for a demo.
