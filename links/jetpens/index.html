              The prompt for this project was to take an existing website and
              make a one-page re-design for it. The tool used for this was
              Figma.
              <br />
              For this one page re-design, I selected JetPens as my website of
              choice since it is a site I frequent, and the site in its current
              state is rather outdated. A screenshot of the current JetPens site
              can be seen below.
            </p>
            <img
              class="tu"
              src="jetpens current.png"
              alt="A screenshot of the current JetPens website, which is white and taupe 
              with Time New Roman font and a simple design, reminscent of the early 2010s."
            />
            <p>
              The first step of this re-design was to explore the colors, font,
              and other inspirations I wanted to pull from when creating the new
              website design.
              <br />
              I found different fonts using Google Fonts, and used RED, a
              Pinterest-esque social media site, to find inspiration photos. I
              browsed and searched for modern and minimalistic websites with
              visually interesting themes to draw inspiration from as well.
              Finally, I used Adobe Color Wheel to explore different color
              palettes for the website.
            </p>
            <img
              class="tu"
              src="jetpens moodboard.png"
              alt="A moodboard showing a collage of different green color palettes, 
              fonts, and screenshots of minimalistic websites. There are also reference 
              images of nature, desks, and stationery."
            />
            <p>
              The next step of my design process was to create different low- to
              mid-fidelity wireframes. These designs, although simple, were an
              unique challenge for me to take on. Once I had an idea for what
              the re-design could look like, I explored different smaller
              changes it could take, tweaking the elements and layout until I
              had three different designs. From this, I could get feedback from
              my peers and evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each design.
              <br />
              During this step, I also created components for the wireframes,
              which could be quickly formatted using the Auto Layout tool.
              Creating these components made it easier for me to make changes to
              multiple elements later on in the design process.
            </p>
            <img
              class="tu"
              src="jpw.png"
              alt="3 different wireframes for the JetPens re-design, side by side."
            />
            <p>
              After getting feedback from my peers and assessing the different
              wireframes, I began to create the final re-design from a
              combination of the first and second wireframes.
              <br />
              One of the first major changes I made to the final was the color
              of the site background. Although the JetPens green color would
              bring an impactful first impression, I decided it was not
              user-friendly. Since JetPens is an ecommerce site selling
              stationery, users would want to see color-accurate product photos.
              With a green background, their perception of color would be
              distorted and can result in regretful purchases. Additionally,
              this color would be straining on the eyes when spending longer
              times on the site.
              <br />
              Following the change of the background color, the other design
              changes I made were less extreme. I fixed the sizing for many
              elements to bring better cohesion to the site.
              <br />
              Following these small changes, I began to edit the components for
              the finalized version. This involved creating overlay effects and
              re-sizing elements to better suit the contents of the page. During
              this step, I also created a login/sign-up popup menu.
              <br />
              The popup menu and components can be seen below.
            </p>
            <img
              class="tu"
              src="jpp.png"
              alt="An image of the login/sign-up popup screen."
            />
            <img
              class="tu"
              src="jpc.png"
              alt="An image of the various components of the design, such as the 
            product elements and article thumbnails."
            />
            <p>
              Finally, I changed the placeholder text into real text taken From
              the JetPens website, and did the same for images. I then found
              open-source icons for the navigation, search, and social media
              icons on the page. Finally, scrolling and clicking interactions
              were added.
              <br />
              Overall, I believe my re-design reflects the essence of JetPens,
              but brings a modern look and feel to the site and its
              interactions. The re-design is still simple, making it easy for
              customers to navigate and browse.
              <br />
              The final wireframe of the re-design can be seen below, along with
              the prototype (best viewed in fullscreen).
