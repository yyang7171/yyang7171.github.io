# INST630 Final Project: Art Institute of Chicago

## About the project
This project uses the Art Institute of Chicago's API to fetch data about artworks, including the name of the work, the artist, and the image. Due to limitations of the API, only 100 works can be fetched per request. Please allow some time for the site to load, as the images are not stored in the API and need to be downloaded using their ID given by the API.

## Using the site
On the homepage, click the "Show All Artworks" button to make the API call and view the artworks from the Institute. The chart at the top of the artworks page will load and display the number of artworks per artist.

## Tools used
This site was coded using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. GSAP was used to animate the header text on the homepage, and Chart.js was used to create the chart for the results page. Additional troubleshooting was done with Claude.ai.

## Acknowledgements
I would like to thank Shruti, who helped me get started with making the API call and displaying the results to my page. Additional thanks to Shreya and Ruibin for their support in creating this project.
